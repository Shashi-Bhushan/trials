# Algo Trials

This directory has been my primary playground for algorithm trials.

I've started with this course and will be logging progress here

#### 1. **Algorithms** - *Rebort Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne*

Coursera link [here](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1/home/welcome)

Kevin Wayne's [github repo](https://github.com/kevin-wayne/algs4) which hosts the base code for standard input output that I used in this project at many places.

Also, check out [this](https://github.com/reneargento/algorithms-sedgewick-wayne) repo. The guy is nice enough to share the solutions for all the questions in the book.
I took inspiration from this on some of the solutions I wrote and blatantly copied his code in some other places :D

##### Few noteworthy Solutions

- [Majority](https://github.com/Shashi-Bhushan/trials/blob/master/algo-trials/src/main/java/in/shabhushan/algo_trials/algorithms/chapter1/section4/webexercise/Exercise5Majority.java)
